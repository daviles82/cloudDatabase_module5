# Overview

A software engineer knows how to create software; a good way to test this is by showing others how. A sound engineer can develop and design great software, but he needs to be able to code and explain it consistently. This tutorial is a great way to help others succeed in their eventual journey to software engineering.

This tutorial focuses on setting up a simple code base to showcase the ease of working with cloud databases in a user-friendly language like Python. Python calls on the database over a network to reach offsite servers. These servers, called cloud databases, can be accessed with the correct API_KEY. Python has a unique library called Tkinter that is useful for interacting with cloud databases like MongoDB.

## Cloud Database

The cloud database used is MongoDB. The Mongo in MongoDB is derived from the word huMONGOus. This database is flexible as it is considered a NoSQL database. NoSQL means “Not Only SQL.” MongoDB can be installed in an IDE like Visual Studio Code, and the desktop version called Compass can be downloaded for local usage and cloud management.

This tutorial utilized NoSQL. The data structure uses unique, flexible structures depending on the data insertion. Data is stored in documents based on BSON, also known as binary JSON.

## Development Environment

This software was developed using Microsoft Windows 11 and an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. The IDE used is Visual Studio Code, also from Microsoft, which makes integration seamless and provides excellent support.

In this tutorial, Python was used with Tkinter, a library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Python is a programming language focused on data structures, while Tkinter is known for interacting with those structures.
